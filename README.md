## Smart Contract Project with Truffle-React Suite

-- Overview

This project is a demonstration showcasing a smart contract to transfer ETH using MetaMask wallet developed using the Truffle framework, seamlessly integrated with React.js for the frontend. The smart contract has been deployed on the Goerli test network, offering a secure and decentralized environment for experimentation. Users can interact with the smart contract through an intuitive and user-friendly interface provided by the frontend. 

-- Features

**Smart Contract:** The project includes a smart contract developed using Solidity language. This contract defines the business logic and rules for the application.
  
**Truffle Suite:** Truffle framework is used for compiling, deploying, and testing the smart contract. Truffle provides a suite of tools for smart contract development.
  
**React Interface:** The frontend of the application is built using React.js, providing an intuitive user interface for interacting with the smart contract.
  
**Blockchain Integration:** The smart contract is deployed on a blockchain network (such as Ethereum), enabling decentralized execution and data immutability.

-- Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/AtishNayak/contract-truffle-react.git
    ```

2. Compile and migrate the smart contracts:

    ```
    truffle compile
    truffle migrate
    truffle migrate --network goerli
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```
    cd client
    npm start
    ```

-- Usage

Once the development server is running, you can access the frontend interface by navigating to `http://localhost:____` in your web browser. Use the interface to interact with the smart contract according to its functionalities.
