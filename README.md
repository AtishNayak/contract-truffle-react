## Smart Contract Project with Truffle-React Suite

-- Overview

This project is a demonstration of a smart contract developed using Truffle framework and integrated with React.js for the frontend. The smart contract is deployed on a blockchain network and interacts with the frontend through a user-friendly interface.

-- Features

**Smart Contract:** The project includes a smart contract developed using Solidity language. This contract defines the business logic and rules for the application.
  
**Truffle Suite:** Truffle framework is used for compiling, deploying, and testing the smart contract. Truffle provides a suite of tools for smart contract development.
  
**React Interface:** The frontend of the application is built using React.js, providing an intuitive user interface for interacting with the smart contract.
  
**Blockchain Integration:** The smart contract is deployed on a blockchain network (such as Ethereum), enabling decentralized execution and data immutability.

-- Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/AtishNayak/contract-truffle-react.git
    ```

2. Compile and migrate the smart contracts:

    ```
    truffle compile
    truffle migrate
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```
    cd client
    npm start
    ```

-- Usage

Once the development server is running, you can access the frontend interface by navigating to `http://localhost:____` in your web browser. Use the interface to interact with the smart contract according to its functionalities.
